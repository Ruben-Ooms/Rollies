## How to Roll
### DND
These include single, multi die, advantage, disadvantage, and emphasis rolls.

Basic Rolls:
To perform a single roll enter a single number.
To perform a mulitroll enter the number of dice and then the number of die sides seperated by a "d". Example: 5d6

Roll Modifiers:
To perform a roll with advantage, append an "A" to a basic roll.
To perform a roll with disadvantage, append a "D" to a basic roll.
To perform a roll with emphasis, append an "E" to a basic roll.

Multiple rolls can be performed at once by adding a space between them. However, only one modifier can be applied to each roll.

### Animon
All roles are performed with a d6. So the user must enter the number of d6 to roll.

Roll Modifiers:
To perform a roll with a setback, append an "S" to a basic roll.
To perform a roll with boost, append a "B" to a basic roll.
Multiple can be appended and the effective number of setbacks or boosts will be caluclated.

Multiple rolls can be performed at once by adding a space between them.
